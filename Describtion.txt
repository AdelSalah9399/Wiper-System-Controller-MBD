*Intro:
	The Wiper System Controller project involves the development of a Simulink model and the generation of corresponding code.
	This controller is designed to control the operation of a wiper system, which is commonly used in vehicles to clear the windshield or rear window.
	This code can be implemented on a microcontroller or embedded system to bring the wiper system controller to life.

*Describtion:
	our system contains 2 sub-systems, 3inputs and 2 outputs
sub_systems:
	1-wiper_main algorithm
	2-smothing_algorithm
Inputs:
	1-mode(off-low speed-high speed)
	2-RainSensor state
	3-Speed(7 steps of wiper motor speed)
outputs:
	1-motor PWM
	2-System State
